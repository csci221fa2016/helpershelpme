# Helpers Help Me

CSCI 221 Fall 2016 class project to provide an easy way to find, organize, and join events. During the completion of the website, we followed these user stories:
    -- Easily join/leave an event at specific dates and times and location
    -- See your listing of events
    -- See the listing of all events
    -- Easily view profile stats
    -- I would like to easily select dates and times for which the event is to be held
    -- Location based events
    -- Description of event
    -- Detail positions that volunteer need to fill
